## Database Design
- Connection Pooling for Efficient DB Access
createPool method to manage database connections efficiently, ensuring that multiple requests can be handled simultaneously without opening a new connection each time.

- Auto-Handling of Connection Lifecycle
The connection pool automatically handles acquiring and releasing connections, providing a more efficient way to manage resources and ensuring that unused connections are returned to the pool. This also minimizes the risk of connection leaks.
